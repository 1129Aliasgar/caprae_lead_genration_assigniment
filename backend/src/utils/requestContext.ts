/**
 * Per-request context, carried implicitly.

 *
 * AsyncLocalStorage keeps the context attached to the async execution
 * instead: `requestContextMiddleware` enters it once per request, and
 * anything awaited downstream can read it back with `getRequestContext()`
 * — no arguments, and it survives the awaits between layers.
